Escalators can be found everywhere in modern cities, bringing convenience to people's 
lives. With the gradual increase of high-rise buildings and the steady improvement of grades in 
today's era, it is not only required that elevators be fast and comfortable when they are boarding, 
but people are increasingly demanding for the safety and reliability of elevators, and escalators 
are also developing in an intelligent direction. 
Based on Jetson Xavier embedded equipment, this thesis has developed an intelligent video 
surveillance system for escalators. The system analyzes the images collected by the cameras 
taken from three different directions to complete the detection and tracking of passenger heads 
and large items on the escalator floor, as well as the extraction and tracking of the passenger 
skeleton on the escalator. On the basis of this, the functions of passenger flow statistics, pas-
senger retrograde detection, passenger congestion detection, passenger behavior recognition, 
and large item retention detection are realized. The main work of this thesis includes the fol-
lowing four aspects: 
1)Passenger head and large items detection: After comparing the advantages, disadvantages 
and limitations of traditional foreground extraction methods, machine learning and deep learn-
ing methods, YOLOv3-tiny was finally selected as the passenger head detection method, and 
KNN background modeling algorithm combined with KD tree algorithm was selected to detect 
large items. 
2) Passenger head and large items tracking in overhead scenes: After comparing various 
tracking methods, Kalman filtering is used to perform motion estimation on the passenger's 
head, and the Hungarian matching algorithm is used to match the rectangular frame intersection 
matrix of the tracking result and detection result to match the passenger head. Hungarian match-
ing algorithm is used to match large items in adjacent frames to achieve large item tracking. 
Based on the tracking results, the behavior of passengers and items on the escalator floor is 
detected, including passenger flow statistics, passenger retrograde, passenger detention, pas-
senger congestion, and large item detention.
