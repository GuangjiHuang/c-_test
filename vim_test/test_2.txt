To copy all lines containing a search pattern, use the following (see here). The first command clears register a (:help q). The second appends all matching lines to that register (:help quotea). The third copies register a to the clipboard (register +) for easy pasting into another application. Replace pattern with what you want to search for, or omit it (:g//y A) to use the last search.
## you can use the command qxq to clear the content of the register;
for example the qeq to clear the e's content.
